                    <p>The Smart Start School is a British school of classical ballet training founded in 1926 by the Anglo-Irish 
                        ballerina and choreographer Ninette de Valois. The school's aim is to train and educate outstanding classical 
                        ballet dancers, especially for the Royal Ballet (based at the Royal Opera House in London) and the Birmingham 
                        Royal Ballet.
                        
                        Admission to the school is based purely on dancing talent and potential, regardless of academic ability or personal 
                        circumstances, and 90% of current students rely on financial support to attend the school. The school is based at 
                        two sites, White Lodge, Richmond Park (for students aged 11–16) and Covent Garden (for students from 16 to 19 years 
                        old) based in purpose-built studios on Floral Street, adjacent to the Royal Opera House.
                        
                        The SMart Start School has produced dancers and choreographers of international renown, including Dame Margot 
                        Fonteyn, Dame Beryl Grey, Sir Kenneth MacMillan, Dame Darcey Bussell, Alessandra Ferri, Viviana Durante, and Sergei
                         Polunin, as well as the current director of The Royal Ballet, Kevin O'Hare. Graduates of the school have also 
                        achieved employment in musical theatre, contemporary and jazz dance, television and 
                        film.</p>
                        <p>In 1926, the Irish-born dancer Ninette de Valois founded the Academy of Choreographic Art, a dance school for girls
                        and the predecessor of today's Smart Start School. Her intention was to form a repertory ballet company and school,
                        leading her to collaborate with theatrical producer and theatre owner Lilian Baylis.</p>

                        <p>Baylis owned the Old Vic theatre and acquired Sadler's Wells theatre in 1925. In 1928, she engaged de Valois to 
                        stage dance performances at both theatres and she re-opened Sadler's Wells theatre in 1931, with de Valois' school 
                        moving into studios on the site as the Sadler's Wells Ballet School, teaching both boys and girls. At the same time,
                        the Vic-Wells Ballet Company was formed using students of the school and other notable dancers of the era. Both 
                        the school and the ballet company developed quickly and after ballet performances ceased at the Old Vic, the ballet
                        company was renamed the Sadler's Wells Ballet.</p>

                        <p>In 1946, the company moved to become the resident ballet company at the newly re-opened Royal Opera House in Covent
                        Garden and as a result, in 1947 the school moved from Sadler's Wells to premises in Barons Court, with academic 
                        education being introduced for younger students.</p>

                        <p>Following rapid expansion, in 1955 the school secured the premises at White Lodge in Richmond Park, London. 
                        This was established at the time as the Royal Ballet 'Lower School', a residential boarding school for children 
                        aged 11–16, combining general education and vocational ballet training.
                        The Royal Ballet School 'Upper School' was established at the school's existing premises in Barons 
                        Court with students studying ballet on a full-time basis between the ages of 16–19.</p>

                        <h2 style="text-align:center">Performance</h2>
                        <p>Each year The Royal Ballet School presents its Summer Performances, featuring students from all age 
                         groups in a wide variety of classical and contemporary works. The highlight of the school's dance 
                        year is the annual matinée at the Royal Opera House, which showcases graduate students before they 
                        embark on their professional careers as well as featuring students from all years of the school. 
                        The programme includes new works and heritage pieces from the Royal Ballet repertory and culminates 
                        in a grand défilé, in which every student of the school appears on stage in a choreographed curtain 
                        call.</p>
